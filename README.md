## command

command represents one or more commands separated by ';'. Be ware that the commands can not contain ' as hexo would assume that the argument is finished and the next will follow what will lead to the object not beeing rendered.

## minHeight

minHeight defines the minimal hight of the editor/terminal window. Beware that it can grow depending on the content you provide.

## windowTitle

windowTitle will be displayed as title of the editor/terminal window. Use whatever you like.

## onCompleteDelay

onCompleteDelay defines the wait delay, after a line of commands/code was typed. This does not affect the content in gdemo_terminal. Content will instantly appear after all commands are typed.

## promptString

The promptString defines, which character or character sequence will be displayed in front of the typed commands. You can use '>' or 'root@local:/$ ' or anything else you like to display.

## id

The id parameter sets a unique id for the instance of editor/terminal. The IDs have to be different for multiple instances inside of the same post.

## highlightingLang

highlightingLang defines the designated highlighting language. If not specified, javascript will be used. You can find a list of supported languages at the [prismjs homepage](https://prismjs.com/#supported-languages).
